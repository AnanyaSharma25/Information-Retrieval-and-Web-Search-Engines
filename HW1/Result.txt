As we can see from the results, after comparing the two search engines (Google and Ask) on 100 queries, the average percent overlap comes out to be 57.40
On an average, for a given query, Ask produces at least 5 same results as Google would on the same query. The Spearman coefficient is -1.1879, which indicates that although at least 5 results match, their ranking isn't the same, so there isn't much similarity between the two search engines.
Hence, the Ask search engine doesn't perform better than the Google search engine and is in fact worse than Google.
